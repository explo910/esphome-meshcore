# esphome-meshcore

An [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) external component that embeds the
[MeshCore](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore) LoRa mesh library
into an ESP32-based ESPHome node. Lets you build a Home Assistant
connected mesh endpoint without writing PlatformIO firmware from
scratch.

> Status: **builds end-to-end** against ESPHome 2026.5 + arduino-esp32
> 3.3.8 + MeshCore 1.17.x (RadioLib pinned to the exact commit upstream
> builds against). Validated on Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3 (SX1262) and TTGO
> T-Beam (SX1276). Identity persists across reboots, RTC learns time from
> the mesh, channel messaging is wire-compatible with upstream
> `BaseChatMesh`. See [Roadmap](#roadmap) for what's still open.

## Quick start

> **Requires `framework: arduino`** on the ESP32. MeshCore and RadioLib
> pull in `<SPI.h>`, `<Arduino.h>`, and friends that don't exist under
> the esp-idf framework. The component fails config validation with a
> clear message if you try `framework: esp-idf`.

1. Drop the repo into your ESPHome YAML:

   ```yaml
   external_components:
     - source:
         type: git
         url: hhttps://github.com/blackax1/esphome-meshcore.git
         ref: main
         refresh: 0s        # while iterating; remove once you pin a tag
       components: [meshcore]
   ```

2. Configure the hub against your LoRa module pins. Note we own the
   SPI bus directly — do **not** also add an `spi:` block. MeshCore's
   helpers call `SPI.begin()` internally with the pins we provide.

   ```yaml
   meshcore:
     id: mesh_hub
     radio: sx1262
     sclk_pin: GPIO9
     miso_pin: GPIO11
     mosi_pin: GPIO10
     cs_pin: GPIO8
     dio1_pin: GPIO14
     reset_pin: GPIO12
     busy_pin: GPIO13
     firmware_version: "1.0.0"
     owner.info:
       name: "John Doe"
       serial: "SN-2026-0001"
     channels:
       - name: "Public"
         key: "izOH6cXN6mrJ5e26oRXNcg=="

   text_sensor:
     - platform: meshcore
       meshcore_id: mesh_hub
       last_message:
         name: "Mesh Last Message"

   sensor:
     - platform: meshcore
       meshcore_id: mesh_hub
       rssi:
         name: "Mesh Last RSSI"
       snr:
         name: "Mesh Last SNR"
       battery_voltage:
         name: "Mesh Battery Voltage"
   ```

3. Send a message from a HA automation or button:

   ```yaml
   button:
     - platform: template
       name: "Send Mesh Message"
       on_press:
         then:
           - meshcore.send_text_message:
               id: mesh_hub
               channel: "Public"
               text: "Hello from ESPHome!"
   ```

See [`example.yaml`](./example.yaml) for a complete file.

### `firmware_version` in self-advert

Set `firmware_version` on the `meshcore:` block to include the firmware
version in your node's self-advert packet. Other nodes will display the
version in their node lists.

```yaml
meshcore:
  id: mesh_hub
  radio: sx1262
  # ... pins ...
  firmware_version: "1.2.0"
  channels:
    - name: "Public"
      key: "izOH6cXN6mrJ5e26oRXNcg=="
```

### `owner.info` in self-advert

Set `owner.info` on the `meshcore:` block to include owner identification
information in your node's self-advert packet. When a node is lost, other
nodes in the mesh can see the owner details to return it.

```yaml
meshcore:
  id: mesh_hub
  radio: sx1262
  # ... pins ...
  owner.info:
    name: "Jane Doe"
    serial: "SN-2026-0042"
    model: "heltec_v3"
  channels:
    - name: "Public"
      key: "izOH6cXN6mrJ5e26oRXNcg=="
```

| Field | Required? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | no | Owner's name |
| `serial` | no | Device serial number |
| `model` | no | Device model (e.g., `heltec_v3`, `t-beam`) |

### `path.hash.mode` in self-advert

Set `path.hash.mode` on the `meshcore:` block to control the length of
the path hash used in self-advert packets. This reduces packet overhead
by shortening the hash portion of the packet.

```yaml
meshcore:
  id: mesh_hub
  radio: sx1262
  # ... pins ...
  path.hash.mode: 2  # Use 2-byte path hash instead of default 4
  channels:
    - name: "Public"
      key: "izOH6cXN6mrJ5e26oRXNcg=="
```

Valid values:
- `4` (default): Full 4-byte path hash
- `3`: 3-byte path hash (saves 1 byte per advert)
- `2`: 2-byte path hash (saves 2 bytes per advert)

### `channels:` entries

| Field | Required? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | Human-readable label, must match what other clients use for the same PSK |
| `key` | yes | Pre-shared key. Accepts either base64 (`izOH6cXN6mrJ5e26oRXNcg==`) or hex (`f8f5e10540e58c73170ec33d1b7194bf`). Must decode to 16 or 32 bytes |

The upstream MeshCore "Public" channel PSK is
`izOH6cXN6mrJ5e26oRXNcg==`. Use a different key for a private channel
(generate with `openssl rand 16 | base64`).

### `text_sensor:` (sub-platform)

```yaml
text_sensor:
  - platform: meshcore
    meshcore_id: <hub id>
    last_message:        # optional; only added if you list it
      name: "Mesh Last Message"
```

Publishes the parsed `"<sender>: <text>"` string from the most recent
`PAYLOAD_TYPE_GRP_TXT` packet on any configured channel.

### `sensor:` (sub-platform)

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: meshcore
    meshcore_id: <hub id>
    rssi:                # optional
      name: "Mesh Last RSSI"
    snr:                 # optional
      name: "Mesh Last SNR"
    battery_voltage:     # optional; needs battery_pin on the hub
      name: "Mesh Battery Voltage"
```

`rssi`/`snr` reflect the most recent received packet. `battery_voltage`
samples once a minute via `mesh::MainBoard::getBattMilliVolts`.

### `on_message` trigger

You can use the `on_message` trigger on the `meshcore` hub to process incoming messages dynamically. The trigger exposes `channel`, `payload`, `rssi`, and `snr` variables for use in lambdas and conditions.

```yaml
meshcore:
  id: mesh_hub
  # ... other config ...
  on_message:
    then:
      - if:
          condition:
            lambda: 'return channel == "Public";'
          then:
            - logger.log:
                format: "Received public message: %s (RSSI: %.1f, SNR: %.1f)"
                args: ['payload.c_str()', 'rssi', 'snr']
```

### GPS coordinates in self-advert

Set `gps_latitude` and `gps_longitude` on the `meshcore:` block to include
GPS coordinates in your node's self-advert packet. Other nodes that receive
the advert will store the location in their routing tables, enabling
location-based routing (hops, distance estimates) and letting you see where
nodes live on a map.

```yaml
meshcore:
  id: mesh_hub
  radio: sx1262
  # ... pins ...
  gps_latitude: 37.7749
  gps_longitude: -122.4194
  channels:
    - name: "Public"
      key: "izOH6cXN6mrJ5e26oRXNcg=="
```

Both fields use ESPHome's `cv.latitude` / `cv.longitude` validators
(±90 / ±180 range). Leave them unset if the node has no GPS fix — the
advert is sent with `lat = 0, lon = 0` which upstream tools treat as
"unknown location".

### `meshcore.send_text_message` action (formerly `meshcore.send_message`)

The `meshcore.send_text_message` action builds and sends a group text
message to all nodes on a configured channel.

```yaml
meshcore.send_text_message:
  id: mesh_hub
  channel: "Public"
  text: "Hello from ESPHome!"
```

If `channel` is omitted, the message is sent on the first configured
channel (matching the legacy `meshcore.send_message` behaviour):

```yaml
meshcore.send_text_message:
  id: mesh_hub
  text: "Hello on the default channel!"
```

**Template support:** Both `text` and `channel` support template values
for dynamic content:

```yaml
- meshcore.send_text_message:
    id: mesh_hub
    channel: !lambda 'return "channel_" + to_string(id(my_number));'
    text: !lambda 'return sprintf("Hello at %02d:%02d", now().hour, now().minute);'
```

> **Note:** `meshcore.send_message` is a deprecated alias for
> `meshcore.send_text_message`. It will be removed in a future release.

### `meshcore.send_self_advert` action

Manually trigger a self-advert broadcast. Useful for button presses or
periodic triggers to re-advertise your node's presence in the mesh.

```yaml
button:
  - platform: template
    name: "Re-advertise Node"
    on_press:
      then:
        - meshcore.send_self_advert:
            id: mesh_hub
```

| Field | Required? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | The meshcore hub id |
| `channel` | no | Channel name (must match a configured channel). Omitted = first configured channel |
| `text` | yes | Message text. Supports templatable values |

## Board examples

### Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3 (SX1262)

```yaml
meshcore:
  radio: sx1262
  sclk_pin: GPIO9
  miso_pin: GPIO11
  mosi_pin: GPIO10
  cs_pin: GPIO8
  dio1_pin: GPIO14
  reset_pin: GPIO12
  busy_pin: GPIO13
  tcxo_voltage: 1.6
  dio2_as_rf_switch: true
  rx_boosted_gain: true
```

### TTGO T-Beam (SX1276)

```yaml
i2c:                     # AXP192 PMIC + OLED live on bus 0
  sda: GPIO21
  scl: GPIO22

meshcore:
  radio: sx1276
  sclk_pin: GPIO5
  miso_pin: GPIO19
  mosi_pin: GPIO27
  cs_pin: GPIO18
  dio0_pin: GPIO26
  reset_pin: GPIO23
  # dio1_pin omitted -- T-Beam doesn't wire it; RadioLib polls
  tx_power: 17           # SX1276 PA_BOOST tops out here
```

The T-Beam's AXP192 powers the LoRa radio by default, so no PMIC
component is strictly required. If your radio fails to init with
`status=-2`, the LoRa LDO is the first thing to suspect.

## How it works

- The Python `__init__.py` translates each YAML radio param into the
  compile flags MeshCore's `CustomSX126x` / `CustomSX1276` helpers
  already read (`P_LORA_*`, `LORA_FREQ`, `LORA_BW`, `LORA_SF`,
  `LORA_TX_POWER`, `SX126X_DIO3_TCXO_VOLTAGE`, ...). Avoids forking
  the upstream helpers.
- We bypass `std_init()` and call RadioLib's `begin()` directly so
  init failures surface with a numeric error code in the ESPHome log.
- Build flags enable `RADIOLIB_GODMODE` + `RADIOLIB_STATIC_ONLY` and
  exclude the ham-radio modules MeshCore doesn't use.
- `cg.add_library("SPI"|"Wire"|"Preferences", None)` re-enables those
  Arduino bundled libs, which since [ESPHome 2026.2 are off by
  default](https://developers.esphome.io/blog/2026/02/12/esp32-arduino-selective-compilation-libraries-disabled-by-default/).
- `MeshCoreComponent::setup()` brings up MeshCore's `ESP32Board`,
  `SimpleMeshTables`, `StaticPoolPacketManager`, then constructs a
  `CustomSX1262` / `CustomSX1276` driven by the `SPI` instance.
- Identity (96-byte prv+pub blob) is loaded with priority:
  1. `private_key:` from YAML — pin a deterministic identity across
     reflashes. Recommended pattern: `private_key: !secret ...`.
  2. NVS cache via ESPHome's `global_preferences` — the keypair
     generated on first boot persists across reboots.
  3. Fresh RNG seed and saved to NVS on first boot.
- The local RTC starts at MeshCore's 2024-05-15 baseline and learns
  real time from inbound advert and `PAYLOAD_TYPE_GRP_TXT` timestamps.
  Persisted to NVS so subsequent boots don't fall back to the
  baseline. Off-grid nodes converge their clock without WiFi/NTP/GPS.
- Each YAML `channels[]` entry decodes its PSK, hashes with SHA256 to
  produce the routing path-hash, and is held in a
  `std::vector<ChannelDetails>`. `EsphomeMesh::searchChannelsByHash`
  hands matches back to the dispatcher.
- Inbound `PAYLOAD_TYPE_GRP_TXT` packets land in
  `EsphomeMesh::onGroupDataRecv`, get decoded into the
  `"sender: text"` string, and pushed to the bound `text_sensor`
  along with RSSI/SNR.
- `meshcore.send_text_message` builds the
  `[ts(4)|txt_type(1)|"name: msg\0"]` frame, encrypts it under the
  channel PSK via `Mesh::createGroupDatagram`, and floods it. Wire-
  compatible with any other `BaseChatMesh`-derived node.
- In `role: repeater`, `allowPacketForward` returns true so the
  dispatcher flood-forwards traffic. The node also broadcasts a
  self-advert at boot so other nodes can discover it.
- Trace packets that arrive at this node as their final destination
  are logged with per-hop SNR (useful for debugging mesh topology
  from a phone's "trace route" button). Repeater-mode nodes that see
  trace packets in transit will append their SNR and forward
  automatically — that's the upstream default behaviour we get for
  free.

## Notes on the build

- **Vendored ed25519**: MeshCore's `Identity.cpp` includes
  `<ed_25519.h>` but ships those C files in `lib/ed25519/`, which PIO
  doesn't pull in when MeshCore is consumed as a library. We mirror
  that directory under `libs/ed25519/` with a tiny `library.json`,
  and point `lib_extra_dirs` at it.
- **Verified**: `esphome compile example.yaml` produces a working
  ~960 KB `firmware.bin` for `heltec_wifi_lora_32_V3` (SX1262) and
  ~1.1 MB factory image for `t-beam` (SX1276) including AXP192
  battery template-sensors and GPS UART.

## Roadmap

- [ ] `advert_interval:` for periodic re-advertising in repeater mode
      (boot-only currently).
- [ ] Replace `esp_random()` RNG seed with `RadioNoiseListener` for
      proper entropy at first boot before the radio has been heard
      from.
- [ ] Contact/peer support via `BaseChatMesh` (sender lookup by
      pubkey, ACKs, paths, contact list management).
- [ ] Optional `text_sensor` that publishes the *full* `"sender:
      text"` string vs just `text`, configurable via YAML.
- [ ] Region map / regulatory presets (use upstream `RegionMap.h`).
- [ ] Optional BLE Companion Radio mode mirroring upstream's example.
- [ ] Pin `lib_deps` to a tagged MeshCore release once stable.
